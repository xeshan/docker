## Getting Started

This container is recommended for development use, to mirror or mimic development of an AWS EC2 instance running Amazon Linux. 


#### Build Image
Navigate to directory containing docker file. If downloading from Docker Hub, move on to "Create Container" section.

```
docker build -t imageName .
```


### Create Container

You will most likely want to develop on your local machine. Create your directory structure on your local machine and figure out where you want your web root to reside. Update the -v ~/www:/var/www/html with the path to your working directory. You can obviously change this to include multiple filepath mappings, where needed.

```
# Custom Image Build
docker run -ti --name lamp -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 3306:3306 -p 11211:11211 -p 27017:27017 -v ~/www:/var/www/html -d imagesName

# Download and Build from Docker Hub
docker run -ti --name lamp -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 3306:3306 -p 11211:11211 -p 27017:27017 -v ~/www:/var/www/html -d cjonesdev/amazonlinux-lamp
```


### Working with MySQL

By default, the root user doesn't have a password. Run the following to set the root user password.

```
docker exec -ti --privileged lamp mysql_secure_installation
```


### Login as ec2-user

```
docker exec -ti -u ec2-user lamp bash
```
